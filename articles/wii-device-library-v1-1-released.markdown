We have finally found the time and resources to release a new version of [Wii Device Library](/project/wiidevicelibrary). This version fixes a lot of the reported bugs and more. Here is a short list of the changes in this version:

* Connecting using BlueZ has improved.
* Connecting using MsBluetooth has become more stable and faster.
* Fixed freeze when connecting to a Wiimote with plugged extension under Windows.
* Fixed incorrect behaviour with multiple Wiimotes under Windows.
* Fixed a rare bug that occured on some Vista machines.

Several other fixes and changes have been made. You can get the full changelog at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/wiidevicelibrary/source/list).
