Since the first release of DriveDroid (version 0.5) much has changed. This post summarizes the changes from 0.5 till 0.6.2.

## Distributions

A number of new distributions are now available in the downloadlist:

* Arch Linux

For [a recent list of distributions](https://github.com/FrozenCow/distscraper/tree/master/scrapers) take a look [distscraper](https://github.com/FrozenCow/distscraper), which retrieves the different downloadable image-urls.

The downloadlist now also includes logos of the distributions. The logos are retrieved and slightly altered using [a script in distscraper](https://github.com/FrozenCow/distscraper/blob/master/retrievelogos.sh).

## Compatiblity

Support for the different devices has been improved greately by adding support for hosting iso/img files for 5 new devices/ROMs. There were also a lot of different little incompatiblities between the different Android versions, which now show appropriate messages when a particular feature is not supported on the device.

## Paid version

Last but not least, there is now a paid (no-ads) version available [on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.softwarebakery.drivedroid.paid). No extra features are added to the paid version at the moment, though it always helps development.
