For [a recent list of distributions](https://github.com/FrozenCow/distscraper/tree/master/scrapers) take a look [distscraper](https://github.com/FrozenCow/distscraper), which retrieves the different downloadable image-urls.

The downloadlist now also includes logos of the distributions. The logos are retrieved and slightly altered using [a script in distscraper](https://github.com/FrozenCow/distscraper/blob/master/retrievelogos.sh).

Support for the different devices has been improved greately by adding support for 5 new devices/ROMs and catching the different incompatiblities between the different Android versions.

Last but not least, there is now a paid (no-ads) version available [on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.softwarebakery.drivedroid.paid).
